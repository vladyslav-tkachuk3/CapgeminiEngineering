Step 5: Analyze the Security Implications of SAS Tokens and Expiry Times
Limited Permissions: SAS tokens allow fine-grained control over access permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Expiry Times: Setting expiry times ensures that access is temporary and limits the potential for misuse.

Revoking Tokens: If a token is compromised, you can revoke it by regenerating the storage account keys.

Secure Communication: Always use HTTPS to share and access SAS tokens to prevent interception.
