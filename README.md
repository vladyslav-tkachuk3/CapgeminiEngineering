## Practical Task 1: Deploy a Docker Container to Azure Container Instances (ACI) via Azure Portal
### 1. Create a lightweight Docker image for a simple web application (e.g., a Python Flask app) with minimal dependencies to reduce resource usage.

### 3. Use a lightweight ACI instance (e.g., B1s) to deploy the Docker container from ACR.

### 4. Verify the deployment by accessing the web application via the public IP address provided by ACI.

### 5. Remove the ACI container after verifying the deployment to stop billing.
