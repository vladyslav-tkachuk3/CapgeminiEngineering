### 3. Retrieve only a single secret from Azure Key Vault for testing purposes.
### 4. Remove the ACI container after verifying secure access.
## Practical Task 5: Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with AKS via Azure Portal
### 1. Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with the smallest VM size (e.g., B2s) and the minimum number of nodes (e.g., 1–2).
### 2. Connect to the AKS cluster using Azure Cloud Shell with kubectl.
### 3.Deploy a lightweight Nginx application for verification.
### 4. Delete the AKS cluster immediately after testing to avoid additional VM and cluster costs.
## Practical Task 6: Deploy a Containerized Application on AKS
### 1. Build a lightweight Docker image for a simple web application (e.g., a Node.js app with minimal dependencies) and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
### 2. Reuse the AKS cluster from Task 5 to deploy the application using a Kubernetes deployment and service manifest file.
### 3. Test the application for a limited time and remove the deployment afterward
## Practical Task 7: Configure and Use ConfigMaps and Secrets in AKS
### 1. Create a ConfigMap to store non-sensitive configuration data with only the required key-value pairs for the application.
### 2. Create a Kubernetes Secret to store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) with the least amount of information needed.
### 3. Update the application deployment to use the ConfigMap and Secret.
### 4. Remove the ConfigMap, Secret, and deployment after testing.
## Practical Task 8: Scale Applications in AKS
### 1. Deploy a stateless application to the AKS cluster using minimal resource specifications.
### 2. Use the kubectl scale command to manually scale the application to only 2–3 replicas for testing.
### 3. Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with reasonable CPU usage thresholds to minimize pod creation.
### 4. Simulate load on the application for a short duration and remove the deployment after observing the scaling behavior.
## Practical Task 9: Rolling Update of an Application in AKS
### 1. Deploy a lightweight version of your application to the AKS cluster.
### 2. Update the Docker image to a new version with minimal changes (e.g., color change).
### 3. Perform a rolling update using kubectl set image with minimal replicas to reduce resource usage.
### 4. Verify the update process quickly and remove the deployment after the update
