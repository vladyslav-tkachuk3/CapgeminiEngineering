## Practical Task 4: Configuring Azure File Share and Mounting on a Local Machine
## Set up and access Azure File Storage for shared file access.

### 1. Create a storage account and set up an Azure File Share.
### 2. Upload a file to the file share using the Azure portal.
### 3. Generate a connection script for Windows or Linux and use it to mount the file share on your local machine.
### 4. Verify the mounted file share and ensure it displays the uploaded file.
### 5. Add another file to the file share from the local machine and confirm it reflects in Azure.

## Practical Task 5: Storing and Querying Data with Azure Table Storage
## Set up and use Azure Table Storage for structured data.

### 1. Create a storage account and enable the Table service.
### 2. Create a table named "employee-data".
### 3. Add sample data (e.g., employee IDs, names, and roles) to the table using Azure Storage Explorer or Azure CLI.
### 4. Query the table for specific data using filters (e.g., "Role = Developer").
### 5. Delete specific entries from the table and verify the changes.

## Practical Task 6: Configuring Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for Secure Access
## Secure Azure Storage services using SAS tokens.

### 1. Create a storage account with Blob, File, Queue, and Table services enabled.
### 2. Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token for Blob storage with limited permissions (e.g., read-only access).
### 3. Share the SAS token URL and verify access to the Blob container with the token.
### 4. Repeat the process for File, Queue, and Table services with different permissions.
### 5. Analyze the security implications of SAS tokens and expiry times.

## Practical Task 7: Implementing Security Best Practices with Azure RBAC and Managed Identities
## Securely manage access to Azure resources and integrate services using Managed Identities.

### 1. Configure Azure RBAC for a Storage Account:
#### Create a storage account named "secure-storage".
#### Add a user or service principal with Storage Blob Data Contributor role.
#### Verify that the user or service principal can upload and download blobs to the account.
#### Attempt access with an unauthorized user and verify access is denied.
### 2. Set Up a Managed Identity for an Azure Virtual Machine:
#### Create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) with a system-assigned Managed Identity enabled.
#### Assign the Storage Blob Data Reader role to the Managed Identity for "secure-storage".
#### Connect to the VM and verify that the Managed Identity can access blob data using Azure CLI or a pre-installed script.

## Practical Task 8: Creating and Querying an Azure SQL Database
## Learn to create and query an Azure SQL Database using the Azure portal.

### 1. Create an Azure SQL Database named "test-db" in a new logical SQL server.
### 2. Set the pricing tier to the free tier for cost optimization.
### 3. Use the Query Editor in the Azure portal to create a table named "Products" with columns for ID, Name, and Price.
### 4. Insert a few sample records into the "Products" table using a SQL query.
### 5. Query the table to display all records and verify the data.

## Practical Task 9: Deploying an Azure SQL Database with Automated Backup Configuration
## Set up an Azure SQL Database and configure automated backups.

### 1. Create an Azure SQL Database in a new or existing resource group.
### 2. Choose the desired service tier (e.g., Basic or General Purpose).
### 3. Enable and configure long-term backup retention for the database.
### 4. Use the Azure portal to verify backup settings and review available restore points.
### 5. Test the restore process by creating a new database from a backup.

## Practical Task 10: Getting Started with Cosmos DB
## Set up and explore Cosmos DB by creating a database, managing data, querying, and testing key features like consistency and global distribution.

### 1. Create a Cosmos DB Account:
#### Create a new Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal using the Core (SQL) API.
#### Select a region for the account and use the default settings.
#### Review key features like throughput, consistency levels, and global distribution.
#### Note down the primary and secondary keys for the account.
### 2. Set Up a Database and Container:
#### Create a database named "SampleDB" in the Cosmos DB account.
#### Add a container named "Items" with the partition key set to /category.
#### Use the default throughput settings for the database and container.
### 3. Insert Data Using Data Explorer:
### Open the Data Explorer in the Azure portal.
### Insert at least three sample JSON documents into the "Items" container. Example:
{
"id": "1",
"name": "Smartphone",
"category": "Electronics",
"price": 699
}
### Verify that the documents are successfully added and visible in the Data Explorer.
### 4. Query Data in Cosmos DB:
### Use SQL-like queries in the Data Explorer to retrieve data:
### Retrieve all documents: SELECT * FROM c
### Retrieve specific documents: SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.category = 'Electronics'
### Observe how the partition key affects query results.
### 5. Configure and Test Consistency Levels:
### Review the available consistency levels in the Cosmos DB account: Eventual, Session, Consistent Prefix, Bounded Staleness, Strong.
### Set the account-level consistency to "Session."
### Perform a query or data operation and observe the impact on performance and latency.
### 6. Enable Global Distribution and Test Replication:
### Enable multi-region replication by adding at least one additional region to the Cosmos DB account.
### Insert new data into the primary region and verify that it replicates to the secondary region.
### Perform a manual failover and verify that the secondary region becomes the primary.
### Test data consistency and latency after failover.
